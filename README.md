#About the Course

CSCI 301 continues the introduction to computer science begun in CSCI 201. In this course, we manipulate more complex data structures, and continue to program in C++. We implement abstract data types (ADTs) with data structures and functions that operate on those structures, and we encapsulate these implementations in C++ classes. Thus our approach is object-oriented.

Recursion, in which functions call themselves, is another way to repeat computations; recursion often allows elegant expressions and/or implementations of algorithms. A fundamental construct for building data structures is the pointer, the address of a location in memory. The linked list is an implementation of a list ADT built using pointers. The stack and queue ADTs can be implemented using arrays or pointer-based linked structures.

We consider binary trees, and extend our investigation of sorting algorithms that are more efficient than the simple double-loop sorts. Indeed, we always consider the time complexities of our algorithms. We introduce graphs and some fundamental algorithms for operations on them.

The course emphasizes abstraction and problem decomposition, especially distinguishing and separating the definition, implementation, and use of abstract data types.

Objectives:
To continue developing a disciplined approach to the design, coding, and testing of software.
To write accurate and effective documentation.
To analyze algorithms in terms of their run times.
To understand data abstraction with abstract data types such as sets, ordered lists, stacks, and queues.
To implement these abstractions using data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.
To encapsulate these implementations in classes.
To write and understand recursive algorithms.
To describe and analyze efficient algorithms for searching and sorting.
To introduce graphs and graph algorithms.
To provide a foundation for further study in computer science.


#Projects
"It's in the building ... that you start to really understand what you're doing."
James Dyson, 2013.

Programming projects will be assigned regularly. Each is due at the beginning of class on its due date. Work handed in late will not be accepted, though the one lowest project score will be dropped.

About Programming Projects describes the parts of each project and includes links to the parts of an example project.
